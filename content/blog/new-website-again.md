We are still using Next JS for our site, but now we are leveraging the [fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs) framework. This framework significantly simplifies managing content in a [Next JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) site by handling all the heavy lifting, such as searching, file loading, data validation, and more. With [fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs), we can focus on designing the site to look exactly how we want without worrying about the backend complexities. This has streamlined our workflow and allowed us to implement new features more efficiently.

We have once again updated our website to use a [Next JS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)-based site, hosted on Vercel. This transition was made to incorporate more complex functionalities beyond a simple frontend, such as forums and interactive components (like better and unified searching). Hosting on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) provides us with a robust platform that ensures fast performance, scalability, and seamless integration with our development workflow. This update marks a significant step forward in enhancing user experience and site capabilities.

After extensive experimentation, the Miners Online website has reverted to using Material for MkDocs. Our previous attempts included building websites with Astro, Next JS, Vite Press, Nuxt, and more. However, we found that using Material for MkDocs is much simpler and more efficient for our needs. With just a YAML configuration file and our Markdown-based documentation, Material for MkDocs handles the entire site-building process. Additionally, if needed, we can make further customizations with plugins or custom JS/CSS. This approach has allowed us to maintain a clean and organized documentation site with minimal effort.
