    Our servers are hosted in the United Kingdom. Players elsewhere may experience higher latency.

    Our server plugins and configurations are publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/miners-online), allowing community contributions and transparency.

## Game Modes & Features

<Accordions type="multiple">
  <Accordion title="Are there any game modes?">
    Not yet. The server is in alpha development and currently offers only a basic lobby.
  </Accordion>

    Future modes include Golf (our signature mini-game), creative building challenges, and puzzle adventures. These are designed for small groups and focus on skill and creativity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will there be survival gameplay?">
    No. Mini-game networks focus on short, fun games rather than survival. Traditional SMPs are better suited for that style.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will there be an in-game economy?">
    Yes. Players will earn coins through achievements and participation. The system will include cosmetic rewards, fun unlockables, and light-use tools or equipment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will there be ranks or VIP perks?">
    No. All players have equal access to game modes. Cosmetic rewards and titles are earned through gameplay, not purchases.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are player statistics tracked?">
    Stats like wins, losses, and scores will be tracked per game mode and displayed on profiles and leaderboards. Details are still being finalized.
  </Accordion>
