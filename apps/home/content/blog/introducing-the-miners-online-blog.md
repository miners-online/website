We are pleased to announce the **return of the Miners Online blog**. This space will serve as the official channel for all news, updates, and announcements directly related to the Miners Online project. Our goal is to provide a reliable source of information for anyone following the platform’s development and progress.

## Migration of Legacy Content

As part of the relaunch, content from the legacy blog has been carefully migrated to preserve important posts. Articles that were unrelated to the project have been moved to [my personal blog](https://samsblog.minersonline.uk), ensuring this space remains focused on Miners Online.

## Purpose of the Blog

Going forward, the blog will feature **regular updates on releases, improvements, and key milestones**. By centralizing official communications here, we aim to make it easier for the community to stay informed and engaged with the platform’s ongoing development.

## Looking Ahead

We are excited to continue sharing Miners Online’s journey with you. Bookmark this blog and check back for the latest announcements and updates as the project evolves.
