We’re excited to share that the Miners Online website has been completely redesigned! This update has been a long time coming, and it reflects our ongoing effort to make the site easier to use, more welcoming, and truer to the spirit of what Miners Online is all about.

Miners Online has always been about creating a small, close-knit Minecraft experience where every player matters. Since 2017, it’s been maintained as a passion project, and this redesign follows the same philosophy: keep things simple, honest, and player-focused.

## What’s New

- **Light mode theme switcher** - You can now toggle between themes to suit your style.
- **Simpler navigation** - Finding what you need should feel faster and more intuitive.
- **Refreshed home page** - The new homepage layout is more honest about the scale of Miners Online while still celebrating what makes our community special.
- **Better layouts for rules and FAQ** - These essential pages now fit the rest of the site’s design and are much easier to read.
- **The blog returns** - Our blog is back! Old posts have been migrated here, with off-topic entries moved over to [my personal blog](https://samsblog.minersonline.uk).
- **Clerk-based authentication** - This sets the stage for future site expansions and new features we can’t wait to roll out.

## Looking Ahead

This redesign isn’t just a coat of paint—it’s the foundation for growth. By restoring the blog, simplifying navigation, and introducing a modern authentication system, we’re preparing the site for the next chapter of Miners Online.

We hope you enjoy the new look and feel of the website. As always, thank you for being part of this little corner of the Minecraft world. Your feedback is welcome, and your presence is what keeps Miners Online alive.
