## What Sets Miners Online Apart?

Although there are no active minigames at the moment, our server offers a dynamic platform for experimenting with new game ideas. With a focus on open-source principles, **Miners Online** allows players and developers to work together to create a suite of fun, innovative minigames.

Here’s what makes our server different:

### 1. **Open Development and Customization**

The **Miners Online Minecraft Server** is built on [Minestom](https://minestom.net), an open-source Minecraft server framework. This allows for extensive customization and flexibility, meaning that the server’s future minigames can be shaped and developed based on community input. You don’t just play here—you get the chance to influence the server’s direction by contributing new minigame ideas or improvements.

### 2. **A Collaborative Approach to Minigames**

We believe in building an interactive and cooperative community. Even though there are no minigames yet, our primary goal is to work together to design, develop, and implement engaging minigames that players will love. You can join the conversation, propose ideas, or even help code the games if you’re technically inclined.

### 3. **Focus on Innovation**

Miners Online isn’t about recreating what's been done; it’s about innovating. The minigames we plan to introduce will be unique and unlike anything available on other servers, shaped by the creativity of our community. Whether you want to see competitive challenges, puzzle-based minigames, or something entirely new, you can be part of the brainstorming process.

## How to Get Involved

We’re still in the early stages of developing the minigame suite, and that’s where you come in! Here are ways to contribute:

- **Join the Server:** Even though no minigames are currently active, you can explore the server and get involved in discussions about what should come next. Use the address `minersonline.uk` to connect when the server is live.
  
- **Suggest Minigames:** If you have ideas for exciting minigames or features, share them on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/miners-online/discussions) page. We encourage creativity, so no idea is too big or too small!

- **Contribute to Development:** Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, you can help shape the server by contributing code, testing features, or suggesting improvements. Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/miners-online/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

- **Collaborate on Game Design:** Participate in brainstorming sessions with the community to develop new and innovative minigames. These collaborative efforts will guide the development of the server’s content.

## What’s Next?

The server’s current focus is on the **development and design of minigames**. Here's a sneak peek at what's planned:

- **Player Versus Player (PvP) Challenges:** Competitive minigames that test your combat skills, with varied maps and game modes in the pipeline.
  
- **Team-Based Games:** Collaborative minigames where players work in teams to complete objectives, offering both strategy and action.
  
- **Puzzle and Strategy Games:** For players who enjoy thinking outside the box, we’re planning puzzle-based minigames that challenge your creativity and logic.

As development progresses, these minigames will roll out over time, shaped by feedback from the community.

## Roadmap and Future Plans

While there are no minigames live yet, here’s what you can expect from Miners Online in the coming months:

- **Minigame Prototypes:** We’ll start by releasing prototypes of various minigames for testing and feedback. These early versions will help us refine the final designs.
  
- **Community Testing:** Players will have the chance to participate in testing sessions for new minigames, providing valuable input to improve gameplay and mechanics.

- **Regular Updates:** As more minigames are developed, expect regular updates and new content to keep the experience fresh and exciting.

## Join the Journey

While the server is still in its early stages, your ideas and feedback are crucial to shaping the future of our minigames. Join us on this exciting journey, and together, we’ll create something truly special.
