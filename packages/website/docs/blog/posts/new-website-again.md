After a lot of experimenting, the Miners Online website has returned to using Material for MkDocs.

We have previously attempted to make websites with Astro, Next JS, Vite Press, Nuxt, and more. Using Material for MkDocs is much simpler then these tools because we need just a YAML configuration file and our Markdown based documentation - Material MkDocs will do the file mile of building the site (*however if needed additional configurations can be made with custom plugins, or custom JS/CSS*).
