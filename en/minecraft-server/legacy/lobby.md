The lobby contains a small medieval house designed by the Planet Minecraft user xXKeIvinDudeXx found [online](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/small-medieval-house-schematic-3576946/)

The other parts of the lobby was designed by Castolo found [online](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/small-server-hub-lobby-free-download/) and modified to include jump pads (not functional), rainbow ordered parkour, and a platform for server selection NPCs.
